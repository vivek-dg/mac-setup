Setting up my dev programs on mac


I've already installed a few apps and programs on my mac. This is just some notes on it

* Terminal - leave as is. Have light background since it is better for your eyes
* Firefox - or your favorite browser
* XCode from AppStore
* Homebrew! - definitely a must have for easy installs
  - brew install maven
  - brew install scala
  - brew install git
  - brew install ruby
  - brew install heroku-toolbelt
    * brew upgrade heroku-toolbelt
* Java sdk from Oracle
* STS from spring for Java
* IntelliJ Community Edition for Scala


# Projects and development folder
I've created simple folder called 'dev' in my ~/Documents directory. Inside this I have further categories folder such as '~/Documents/dev/workspace' as a container workspace for all my java, ruby and scala code. Also created '~/Documents/dev/iOS' for all iOS related code. That way XCode and STS can have their own workspaces. We can create other workspaces later as well.

When I need to shift my mac to a new machine, I know my documents folder is automatically transferred by default! Don't have to do any custom folder copies or think I've missed something.
