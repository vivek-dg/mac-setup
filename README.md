Setting up my dev programs on mac


I've already installed a few apps and programs on my mac. This is just some notes on it

* Terminal - leave as is. Have light background since it is better for your eyes
* Firefox - or your favorite browser
* XCode from AppStore
* Homebrew! - definitely a must have for easy installs
  - brew install maven
  - brew install scala
  - brew install git
  - brew install ruby
  - brew install heroku-toolbelt
    * brew upgrade heroku-toolbelt
* Java sdk from Oracle
* STS from spring for Java
* IntelliJ Community Edition for Scala
